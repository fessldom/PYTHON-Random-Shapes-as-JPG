# Python - Create random shapes as JPG file

### Features

 - The shapes are shaped randomly(to an extent)
 - The shapes are colored randomly
### Purpose
I created these three scripts for a coursera course on machine learning but maybe someone else can use this.

### What you can do with it:

You can use this wherever you like, but it would be nice if you notified me.
